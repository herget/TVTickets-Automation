## Ticket

To get your ticket make sure the automation script is running on your machine 30 days before showtime and on a weekday at 8.30am (M-F Los Angeles time).  


## Get there super early

The ticket alone won't guarantee the entrance to the show. Ticket holders will be admitted on a first-come basis as space allows and admission is not guaranteed.
- Be there super early, at least 4 or more hours before the show time
- Leave smartphone and all devices in the car
- Bring your ID and a bring a print out of the ticket
